# Each job in Travis CI has several steps:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/
# The 'language: java' directive sets up sane defaults to test common java applications
# We use the defaults for installing dependencies, compiling and testing maven applications
# In our case it will be 'mvn install' followed by 'mvn test'

# This is to enable CodeCov's coverage
# If a build is successful, the code is submitted for coverage analysis

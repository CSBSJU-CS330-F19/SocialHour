# Travis CI Java documentation can be found in:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/

# This enables the 'defaults' to test java applications:
language: android
dist: trusty
android:
  components:
    # Uncomment the lines below if you want to
    # use the latest revision of Android SDK Tools
    # - tools
    # - platform-tools

    # The BuildTools version used by your project
    - build-tools-29.0.2

    # The SDK version used to compile your project
    - android-29

    # Additional components

# We can specify a list of JDKs to be used for testing
# A list of available JDKs in Trusty can be seed in:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/trusty/#jvm-clojure-groovy-java-scala-images
jdk:
 - openjdk8
 
 script:
  - ./gradlew build --scan -s

# Each job in Travis CI has several steps:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/
# The 'language: java' directive sets up sane defaults to test common java applications
# We use the defaults for installing dependencies, compiling and testing maven applications
# In our case it will be 'mvn install' followed by 'mvn test'

# This is to enable CodeCov's coverage
# If a build is successful, the code is submitted for coverage analysis
